const Hello = () => <div>Welcome to next.js!</div>

// This page is implemented using a "fat-arrow" function,
// a new, more compact kind of function that was introduced in ES6.
// You could also have implemented it using classic functions, e.g.
//
// const Hello = function() {
//   return <div>Welcome to next.js!</div>
// }
//
// Also, please note that this page uses the special name index.js.
// This means you can access it either as localhost:3000/index or just as localhost:3000/

export default Hello
